          <p class="description">With summer now drawing to a close, people are mentally preparing for winter. For many, though, heating their NYC apartments during these freezing months is a battle. <a href="http://observer.com/2014/08/heat-seek-nyc-the-app-set-to-protect-struggling-tenants-this-winter/">Read more</a></p>

          <p class="description">Google’s Nest thermostat makes it easy to save money by automatically turning down the heat when you’re not around. But many people don’t have the luxury of controlling their own temperature settings, let alone the money to buy expensive gadgets that can do it automatically. <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/08/heat-seek-nyc/">Read more</a></p>

          <p class="source">from <a href="http://www.engadget.com/">Engadget</a></p>
          <p class="description">Since it's darn hard getting an inspector to come and verify a heat violation, a new KickStarter project called Heat Seek NYC wants to give people the power to gather their own evidence using simple internet-connected temperature sensors. <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2014/08/27/heat-seek-temperature-monitor-nyc-kickstarter/">Read more</a></p>

          <p class="source">from <a href="http://www.theverge.com/">The Verge</a></p>
          <p class="description">As it stands now, the biggest problem for tenants is gathering enough evidence. You need a city inspector to properly document the low temperatures, but the inspectors are stretched thin, appearing in a 36-hour window that often comes while tenants are at work. If the inspector comes on a warm day, the whole process has to start again. <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/8/27/6075129/Heat-Seek-NYC-smart-temperature-sensor-kickstarter">Read more</a></p>

          <p class="source">from <a href="http://www.bkmag.com/">Brooklyn Magazine</a></p>
          <p class="description">The way it works is simple: tenants install a system of web-enabled sensors throughout their apartments, which automatically take temperature readings every hour and record them in a centralized database online. Tenants, advocates, and watchdog lawyers can then log in to check the data and set alerts if it drops below a certain level. <a href="http://www.bkmag.com/2014/08/26/new-app-will-track-landlords-who-dont-turn-up-the-heat/">Read more</a></p>
